# NimFlatbuffers
A pure nim implementation of Flatbuffers

No function should be missing now.

I am working on a flatc-like tool written in nim, however, ive been informed that in order to be able to add Nim to the official flatbuffers framework, i would need to use c++ and their tools, i might do this in the future, but not now.

Opinions and critics are welcome :)
